# ðŸŽ“ Smart Student Dashboard

A **personal academic dashboard** built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to help me track:

- ðŸ“š Marks across 4 exams (Sessional 1, Mid Term, Sessional 2, End Term)
- ðŸ§® SGPA & CGPA (auto-calculated with credit weighting)
- ðŸ“ˆ Interactive charts (bar, pie, line with smooth animations)
- ðŸ•’ Attendance tracking with next-class advice (whether you can skip or not)
- ðŸ’¾ Snapshots & history (see past performance over time)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Motivation
Managing marks, attendance, and SGPA manually was a hassle for me.  
I wanted **one place** where I could:

- Enter my marks & attendance
- Get **dynamic charts** instead of plain tables
- Know instantly if I could **skip the next class safely**
- Track **SGPA/CGPA over semesters**

So I built this dashboard to **solve my own problem** and later made it open-source so others can use it too.
